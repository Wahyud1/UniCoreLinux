Development Notes:
- This scaffold is a starting point. Expand PKGBUILDs, create real packages for unicore-theme,
  unicore-session, unicore-plistd and unicore-kextctl.
- Test installer in QEMU before using on real hardware.
- Consider adding LUKS support, locale/timezone prompts, and user creation flows.
